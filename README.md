## Features

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse (optional, but recommended)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-root
   ```

2. **Place the Background Music File**

   Ensure that the `CasinoJazz.wav` file is placed in the `resources` directory:

   ```
   project-root
   ├── resources
   │   └── CasinoJazz.wav
   ```

3. **Compile the Project**

   Navigate to the `src` directory and compile the Java files:

   ```bash
   cd src
   javac blackjack/**/*.java
   ```

4. **Run the Game**

   Run the `GameRunner` class to start the game:

   ```bash
   java blackjack.game.GameRunner
   ```

## How to Play

1. When the game starts, you will be greeted with a welcome message and background music will start playing.
2. The game will shuffle the deck and deal two cards to both the player and the dealer.
3. The player will be prompted to place a default bet of $10.
4. The player can choose to hit, stand, or double down:
   - **Hit**: Draw another card.
   - **Stand**: Keep the current hand.
   - **Double Down**: Double the bet and draw one more card.
5. The dealer will then reveal their cards and draw until their hand value is at least 17.
6. The winner is determined based on the hand values, and the player's balance is updated accordingly.
7. The player can choose to play again or exit the game.
